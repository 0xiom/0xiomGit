Welcome to the BANKSTER-specific application general page.

This application is intended to be a looped series of menus with some basic "bank-like/money-service" features.

Features currently in place:
F1:) Recurring menu with max of 3 pages.
F2:) Automatic assignment of fake job where you always get the job.
F3:) Bank information display page (app name, date, fake url, credit)
F4:) Return to Main Menu/Exit functionality WOWWO

Features intended for implimentation:
IF1:) Menu functionality is still broken if you don't put a literal number for choice selection. Need to fix that.
IF2:) Flesh out account services, be able to create/delete/view a stored account (IF2) that can be passed into IF3.
IF3:) Loan services(view, pay, apply, calculator) where IF2 can be passed as an argument to give loan information.
IF4:) Transfer services, pass money information between accounts with given permissions.
IF5:) Stonks, miniature stock game, add modeling similar to mini-NYSE.
